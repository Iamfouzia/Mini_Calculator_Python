# Mini_Calculator_in_Python

This Python project is a simple text-based calculator that performs five basic operations:

1. Addition

2. Subtraction

3. Multiplication

4. Integer Division

5. Average

--> How it Works:
It defines functions for each operation.
It shows a menu to the user with options 1â€“5.
It takes user input for:
Operation choice
Two numbers
It uses if-elif statements to call the correct function based on the user's choice.
The result is displayed using print().

--> Key Concepts Used:

_Functions (def)
_Input from user (input())
_Conditional logic (if-elif-else)
_Formatted output (f-strings)
